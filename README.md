## Project Overview
Explored how students use AI tools using a Kaggle dataset. Formulated 12 questions simulating stakeholder needs, then answered them with SQL. Focused on usage trends, satisfaction, and discipline-based behavior to uncover patterns in AI-assisted learning.

## Key Metrics Calculated

- Undergraduate Vs Graduate Prompt Usage
- Discipline Prompt Usage
- Top 3 Task Types By Prompts
- AI Success Rate
- AI Sessions Thru The Years (2024-2025)

  ##  Visualisations

All visuals were created using Tableau (line graphs, bar charts, KPI cards, and Dashboards).  
The dashboard includes comparisons between:
- Task Types
- Average Prompt Usage
- Year Data

#### Future Improvements

- Add real-world data (e.g., survey stats, inflation from ONS or BoE)
- Automate inflation adjustment using a linked reference table
- Make the dashboard interactive with drop-down filters (e.g., by decade)
- Break out regional trends if additional data becomes available
- Try a remake of this project using Power BI or Tableau for comparison

#### My Thoughts

Overall, I consider this project a success. I was able to structure my analysis around stakeholder-driven questions and translate those into clear, measurable insights using SQL and Tableau. This helped me practice asking the right kinds of business-focused questions and build a dashboard that could easily be presented in a real-world setting. That said, one of the biggest challenges was the lack of variance in the dataset. Many fields had similar values across sessions, which made it difficult to draw strong, distinct patterns. For example, satisfaction ratings and session lengths didn’t vary much, limiting deeper analysis or correlations. This highlighted the importance of rich, diverse data when trying to tell a compelling story through analytics. Despite that, one key insight stood out: regardless of a student's discipline or academic level, AI assistance appeared to be beneficial across the board. Whether undergraduate or graduate, science or arts, students showed consistent engagement and satisfaction—suggesting AI tools have broad, inclusive potential in education.
